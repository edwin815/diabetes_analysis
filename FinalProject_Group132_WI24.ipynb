    "Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that affects an overwhelming number of people in the United States. For this reason, it is paramount that we be able to predict whether or not an individual is at risk of developing diabetes given a set amount of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found that there is prior research<a name=\"diabetes-rate\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#dia-rate) exploring the mortality rate in people with type 2 diabetes. From this, we can see that the mortality rate of people with type 2 diabetes has been increasing as they grow older. The research paper in this reference talks about predicting 5 year mortality rates for people with a higher age with diabetes. This would help predict if an immediate intervention is required. We also discovered that there is a clear correlation between diabetes and gender. According to one study <a name=\"diabetes-gender\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#dia-gender), the population of older people that were diagnosed with diabetes is overwhelmingly male. On the other hand,lower risk populations that were studied show an overwhelming female bias. However, we see that when the population with diabetes amongst the younger age groups were studied, there was a pretty even split between both the sexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we see that there is in fact a correlation between substances usage and the risk of diabetes. According to one study by the NCBI <a name=\"diabetes-smoke\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#dia-smoke) (National Center for Biotechnology Information), we see that men who smoked around 25 cigarettes daily were at greater risk of diabetes. Also, men who drank 30.0 - 49.9 grams of alcohol had a higher relative risk of diabetes. However, the study was conducted on only male professionals in the age range of 40 - 75. We also see that the study is relatively old and we don't know how the correlation plays out in today's world. There has also been some research done on the relationship between socioeconomic status including education and income level on diabetes that we hope to further build on with our project. This research<a name=\"diabetes-income\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#dia-income) shows that there is a strong correlation between income and type 2 diabetes in Canada and we would like to do research primarily based in the United States. The data we are using, while primarily based in the United States, not only contains information about individual body conditions such as BMI and insulin, but also information about a person's nutrition, income, and lifestyle habits. This data should allow us to determine whether or not the given factors impact an individual's risk of diabetes. We hope to address the gaps we found in these studies and conduct a more representative anaylsis covering both eating habits and socieconomic conditions. \n",

    "We expect that a person who smokes, drinks, and has unhealthy eating habits is more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. We also think there is a correlation between having a lower income and having less access to healthy, nutrient-rich food. Essentially, we believe that healthy lifestyle choices and socioeconomic equality play important roles in reducing the prevalence of diabetes and its associated risk factors. We expect income inequalities and unhealthy food and lifestyle choices to increase an individual’s risk of developing diabetes. Conversely, we believe that proper nutrition and reduced intake of alcohol / smoking will lower the rate of diabetes."

    "    Because all of the important variables and other columns contain only numeric values, we will not need a significant amount of pre-processing for the data. However, for the diabetes column, we plan to merge the prediabetes and the no diabetes column since our goal is to have a binary output on whether a patient has diabetes or not. Additionally, we will also merge the fruits and vegetables columns so that we can further streamline the input variables. The food and veggies column is a proxy for healthy eating and blood pressure, insulin, and heart disease are proxies for individual-specific body conditions.  Because there are no missing values, we would just need to look through the dataset and see if there are outliers, as well as normalize for gender. Because this is a general health survey, we also need to remove unnecessary variables such as if a person has health care or not, difficulty walking up and down stairs, and state of mental health. We plan to merge the two datasets  we have by the diabetes column, as both datasets include whether or not an individual has diabetes.  "

    "Description of the dataset: This dataset has data regarding nutrition and income and well as the circumstances of those receiving assistance. There were many more variables in the `Variables` column, but as they were unecessary for our analysis, these variables were removed. This leaves us with two variables that are useful to our analysis, which are the median income and diabetes rate. We will be exploring whether there is a correlation between income and diabetes through this dataset. We will create an additional dataset from this data that focuses on nutrition information and the diabetes rate. Because the nutrition and income variables were divided by different geographic regions (the income rate was based on county, and nutrition information was based on state), it was difficult to create one dataset with both those features. Instead, we decided to split the data into two datasets and conduct our EDA. \n"

    "Looking at the above plots, it appears that more individuals in this dataset do not have diabetes (as the 0 bar is higher in the Diabetes graph) than those that do or have pre-diabetes. Additionally, income seems to be more left-skewed towards, the 8 value, which means individuals in this dataset are in the highest income bracket of at least 75,000 USD a year. In terms of the fruits and veggies graphs, more people appear to be consuming fruits and veggies than those that do not, and very few appear to be heavy alcohol drinkers. These are all factors to consider as we continue our EDA to ensure we do not let the skewed distributions wrongly impact our conclusion. "

The height of each bar represents the proportion of individuals with and without diabetes within each heavy alcohol consumption category. Since the bar for heavy alcohol consumption = 0 is notably higher than the bar for heavy alcohol consumption = 1, it suggests a negative association between heavy alcohol consumption and diabetes. In other words, individuals who do not engage in heavy alcohol consumption are more likely to have diabetes, which is surprising. \n"

    "It seems that diabetic samples are typically older by some amount. We also notice that for non-diabetic samples, the range of ages is more diverse, noticeable by the fact that both the IQR and standard deviation is higher, indicating higher spread. This makes sense since most people in this dataset are not diabetic, so we expect a more diverse range of values. However, diabetic people seem to be centralized at older ages and there aren't a lot of diabetic samples that are young. All of this indicates a positive correlation between Age and BMI. This can be due to certain factors such as older people being less healthier, meaning that older people are more likely to have diabetes."

The mean and median BMI of the diabetic patients are both higher. The spread seems relatively the same, with diabetic patients having a slightly higher spread. This supports our hypothesis that higher BMI typically correlates with a higher likeliness for diabetes. It may possibly be a factor in causing diabetes as well"

    "The mean and median income of non-diabetic patients is certainly higher, which is what we expect due to richer people having better access to healthcare and better access to healthier food. This seems to state that there is a negative correlation between income and likeliness of diabetes. In addition, it seems like the spread of income in diabetic patients is higher as seen by the higher IQR. This spread is due to the fact that there are many samples that have an income lower than that of the median. This is possibly due to the fact that most diabetic samples have an income close to the mean or median, but due to the worse living conditions of poorer people, there are many poorer diabetic patients that cause the spread to be large."

Therefore it's likely due to a cause, such as age in this case affecting the likelihood of diabetes. Practical significance shows that a difference of means of two related distributions is large enough to be meaningful in real life. Instead of the t-value, it relies on a calculated value called an \"effect-size\" that similarly measures the difference between two means relative to standard deviation, just like in a t-test.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A good analogy to compare statistical significance and practical significance is that \"While statistical significance shows that an effect exists in a study, practical significance shows that the effect is large enough to be meaningful in the real world.\"(https://www.scribbr.com/frequently-asked-questions/statistical-significance-vs-practical-significance/). We proved that there may be a correlation between age, bmi, and income and the likelihood of having diabetes, but in reality the correlation may not be meaningful enough for us to really say that age,bmi, and income cause diabetes directly."

The correlation is likely due to the fact that poorer people have worse access to healthcare and healthy food. The reason why it's not as big of a correlation as age or BMI however is likely because it's not a direct cause. It's likely an indirect cause, where low income can affect certain variables such as BMI, fruits, veggies, and blood pressure which in turn affects the likelihood of having diabetes. In addition, there are richer people who still get diabetes due to other factors. Overall, we can infer that lower income does slightly contribute to a higher risk for diabetes, but it may not be the direct cause. We will investigate if it's the direct cause after checking for confounding."

    "There are some ethical concerns regarding equitability we must consider. There may be variations between diabetes rates between gender and ages below 21. Additionally, there are claims that ethinicity affects diabetes rates <a name=\"diabetes-ethnicity\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#dia-ethnicity). It’s not clear why this correlation is reported, but it is a possibility to consider when searching for a dataset. Certain disabilities can also have an impact on diabetes rate and ideally we’d want a dataset that accounts for those disabilities too. Furthermore more, we should also ensure that our dataset contains a diverse set of class and wealth levels too, as lower income individuals may be forced to have a lower quality of life, which may cause a higher risk of diabetes. Therefore, it’s important to sample a diverse set of people in our dataset to account for as many of these differences as possible. We can check for such datasets either by looking at the description of the dataset and by gauging how diverse the dataset is based off of the description, or checking if age, gender, ethnicity, disabilities, and class are variables in the dataset and doing EDA to make sure that the distribution of those variables are diverse. If we cannot find data that accounts for all of these differences, then we must add disclaimers stating as such in order to prevent misinterpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we have a diverse dataset, though, there may still be some issues with equitability. If we don’t have enough variables in the dataset, we can get some correlations that may lead us to identify false causes and false conclusions. For example, let’s say we exclude BMI for the sake of this scenario. Certain population groups may just so happen to have higher BMIs on average for a variety of reasons. BMI could be the actual reason why they typically have a higher risk for diabetes, but if we exclude BMI, we may falsely conclude that certain demographics naturally are more likely to suffer from diabetes, which can be problematic. False conclusions can lead to treatments that can be harmful to people or groups. To solve this, we would have to consider datasets that have many different diverse variables. Lastly, with an ideal dataset that considers all of these problems, the only major issue would be privacy. We wouldn’t want hospitals to release sensitive information from patients without their knowledge or proper consent, for instance. It has to be sourced from willing participants and handled in an approporiate manner, so that no data can be linked back to an individual patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these concerns, we will be both carefully inspecting the datasets we have chosen and their descriptions to ensure that the data, at least on the surface appears to be representative including diverse ages, genders, income levels. We will also be conducting some EDA to ensure that the disctributions of these variables are not skewed. Additionally, we will conduct extensive research to ensure that we are not dropping variables that affect our research question and conclusions. \n",
