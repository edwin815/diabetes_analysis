    "Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that affects an overwhelming number of people in the United States. For this reason, it is paramount that we be able to predict whether or not an individual is at risk of developing diabetes given a set amount of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found that there is prior research<a name=\"diabetes-rate\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#dia-rate) exploring the mortality rate in people with type 2 diabetes. From this, we can see that the mortality rate of people with type 2 diabetes has been increasing as they grow older. The research paper in this reference talks about predicting 5 year mortality rates for people with a higher age with diabetes. This would help predict if an immediate intervention is required. We also discovered that there is a clear correlation between diabetes and gender. According to one study <a name=\"diabetes-gender\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#dia-gender), the population of older people that were diagnosed with diabetes is overwhelmingly male. On the other hand,lower risk populations that were studied show an overwhelming female bias. However, we see that when the population with diabetes amongst the younger age groups were studied, there was a pretty even split between both the sexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we see that there is in fact a correlation between substances usage and the risk of diabetes. According to one study by the NCBI <a name=\"diabetes-smoke\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#dia-smoke) (National Center for Biotechnology Information), we see that men who smoked around 25 cigarettes daily were at greater risk of diabetes. Also, men who drank 30.0 - 49.9 grams of alcohol had a higher relative risk of diabetes. However, the study was conducted on only male professionals in the age range of 40 - 75. We also see that the study is relatively old and we don't know how the correlation plays out in today's world. There has also been some research done on the relationship between socioeconomic status including education and income level on diabetes that we hope to further build on with our project. This research<a name=\"diabetes-income\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#dia-income) shows that there is a strong correlation between income and type 2 diabetes in Canada and we would like to do research primarily based in the United States. The data we are using, while primarily based in the United States, not only contains information about individual body conditions such as BMI and insulin, but also information about a person's nutrition, income, and lifestyle habits. This data should allow us to determine whether or not the given factors impact an individual's risk of diabetes. We hope to address the gaps we found in these studies and conduct a more representative anaylsis covering both eating habits and socieconomic conditions. \n",

   "source": [
    "We expect that a person who smokes, drinks, and has unhealthy eating habits is more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. We also think there is a correlation between having a lower income and having less access to healthy, nutrient-rich food. Essentially, we believe that healthy lifestyle choices and socioeconomic equality play important roles in reducing the prevalence of diabetes and its associated risk factors. We expect income inequalities and unhealthy food and lifestyle choices to increase an individualâ€™s risk of developing diabetes. Conversely, we believe that proper nutrition and reduced intake of alcohol / smoking will lower the rate of diabetes."

However, for the diabetes column, we plan to merge the prediabetes and the no diabetes column since our goal is to have a binary output on whether a patient has diabetes or not. Additionally, we will also merge the fruits and vegetables columns so that we can further streamline the input variables. The food and veggies column is a proxy for healthy eating and blood pressure, insulin, and heart disease are proxies for individual-specific body conditions.  Because there are no missing values, we would just need to look through the dataset and see if there are outliers, as well as normalize for gender. Because this is a general health survey, we also need to remove unnecessary variables such as if a person has health care or not, difficulty walking up and down stairs, and state of mental health. We plan to merge the two datasets  we have by the diabetes column, as both datasets include whether or not an individual has diabetes.  "
