    "**The dataset that we proposed does have one flaw: it only samples Pima Indigenous American women over the age of 21. This restriction on who they sample could be an issue. There may be variations between diabetes rates between gender and ages below 21. There are also some claims that there are some differences between diabetes rates between ethnicities(such as this: example<a name=\"diabetes-ethnicity\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#dia-ethnicity)). It’s not clear why this correlation is reported, but it’s possibly something to consider when searching for a dataset. Certain disabilities can also have an impact on diabetes rate and ideally we’d want a dataset that accounts for those disabilities too. It’s also ideal to consider class and wealth levels too, as poorer people may be forced to live in worse living conditions that may cause a higher risk of diabetes. Therefore, it’s important to sample a diverse set of people in our dataset to account for all of these differences. We can check for such datasets either by looking at the description of the dataset and whether or not they claim that the sample is diverse, or checking if age, gender, ethnicity, disabilities, and class are variables in the dataset and doing EDA to make sure the distribution of those variables are diverse.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even if we have a diverse dataset, though, there may still be some issues with equitability. If we don’t have enough variables in the dataset, we can get some correlations that lead us to identify false causes and false conclusions. For example, let’s say we exclude BMI for the sake of this scenario. Certain population groups may just so happen to have higher BMIs on average for a variety of reasons. BMI could be the actual reason why they typically have a higher risk for diabetes, but if we excluded BMI, we may falsely conclude that they naturally are more likely to suffer from diabetes, which can be problematic. False conclusions can lead to treatments that can be harmful to people or groups. To solve this, we would have to consider datasets that have many different diverse variables. Lastly, with an ideal dataset that considers all of these problems, the only major issue would be privacy. We wouldn’t want hospitals to release sensitive information from patients without their knowledge or proper consent, for instance. It has to be sourced from willing participants.**\n",
