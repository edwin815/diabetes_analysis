    "Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that affects an overwhelming number of people in the United States. For this reason, it is paramount that we be able to predict whether or not an individual is at risk of developing diabetes given a set amount of information. \n",

    "We found that there is prior research<a name=\"research-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#research-note-1) exploring the mortality rate in people with type 2 diabetes. From this, we can see that the mortality rate of people with type 2 diabetes has been increasing as they grow older. The research paper in this reference talks about predicting 5 year mortality rates for people with a higher age with diabetes. This would help predict if an immediate intervention is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered that there is a clear correlation between diabetes and gender. According to one study<a name=\"research-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#research-note-2), the population of older people diagnosed with diabetes is overwhelmingly male. The lower risk populations that were studied show an overwhelming female bias. However, we see that when the population with diabetes amongst the younger age groups were studied, there was a pretty even split between both the sexes. According to another research<a name=\"research-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#research-note-3), the risk of cancer is increased in people with diabetes. Diabetes weakens your immune system against infections and causes an inflammatory response because of high blood sugar levels according to this research<a name=\"research-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#research-note-4)\n",

    "We expect that a person who smokes, drinks, and has unhealthy eating habits is more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. We also think there is a correlation between having a lower income and having less access to healthy food. Essentially, we believe that healthy lifestyle choices and socioeconomic equality play important roles in reducing the prevalence of diabetes and its associated risk factors. We expect income inequalities and unhealthy food and lifestyle choices to increase an individual’s risk of developing diabetes. Additionally, proper nutrition and reduced intake of alcohol / smoking will lower the rate of diabetes. "

    "## Correction regarding Ideal Dataset\n",
    "Our ideal dataset should include individual-specific body condition variables, as well as whether a person smokes / drinks, their eating habits, and income level. The dataset should ideally contain a large number of observations, preferably thousands, to ensure statistical power and generalizability of findings across one specific group of people. Data can be collected from various sources including hospitals, clinics, medical research institutions, and population-based studies. It is essential to ensure that the data collection process is systematic and standardized to minimize bias and ensure reliability. The dataset should be representative of the population and not skewed towards any demographic. A potential dataset would be https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset as this contains all the variables we do need and more. However, we may need to search for more datasets regarding lifestyle choices and health conditions to further support our hypothesis. "

However, for the diabetes column, we plan to merge the prediabetes and the no diabetes column since our goal is to have a binary output on whether a patient has diabetes or not. Additionally, we will also merge the fruits and vegetables columns so that we can further streamline the input variables. The food and veggies column is a proxy for healthy eating and blood pressure, insulin, and heart disease are proxies for individual-specific body conditions.  Because there are no missing values, we would just need to look through the dataset and see if there are outliers, as well as normalize for gender. Because this is a general health survey, we also need to remove unnecessary variables such as if a person has health care or not, difficulty walking up and down stairs, and state of mental health. We plan to merge the two datasets  we have by the diabetes column, as both datasets include whether or not an individual has diabetes.  "

    "There are some ethical concerns regarding equitability we must consider. There may be variations between diabetes rates between gender and ages below 21. There are also some claims that there are some differences between diabetes rates between ethnicities(such as this:<a name=\"diabetes-ethnicity\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#dia-ethnicity)). It’s not clear why this correlation is reported, but it’s possibly something to consider when searching for a dataset. Certain disabilities can also have an impact on diabetes rate and ideally we’d want a dataset that accounts for those disabilities too. It’s also ideal to consider a dataset that contains a diverse set of class and wealth levels too, as poorer people may be forced to live in worse living conditions that may cause a higher risk of diabetes. Therefore, it’s important to sample a diverse set of people in our dataset to account for some or all of these differences, if possible. We can check for such datasets either by looking at the description of the dataset and gauge how diverse the dataset is based off of that, or checking if age, gender, ethnicity, disabilities, and class are variables in the dataset and doing EDA to make sure the distribution of those variables are diverse. If we cannot find data that accounts for all of these differences, then we must add disclaimers stating so in order to prevent misinterpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we have a diverse dataset, though, there may still be some issues with equitability. If we don’t have enough variables in the dataset, we can get some correlations that lead us to identify false causes and false conclusions. For example, let’s say we exclude BMI for the sake of this scenario. Certain population groups may just so happen to have higher BMIs on average for a variety of reasons. BMI could be the actual reason why they typically have a higher risk for diabetes, but if we excluded BMI, we may falsely conclude that they naturally are more likely to suffer from diabetes, which can be problematic. False conclusions can lead to treatments that can be harmful to people or groups. To solve this, we would have to consider datasets that have many different diverse variables. Lastly, with an ideal dataset that considers all of these problems, the only major issue would be privacy. We wouldn’t want hospitals to release sensitive information from patients without their knowledge or proper consent, for instance. It has to be sourced from willing participants.\n",
